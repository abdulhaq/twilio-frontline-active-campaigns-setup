# Twilio Frontline with Active Campaign Setup

Working for one of my client, I faild to find any example/tutorial on how to integrate Twilio Frontline with Active Campaigns. With this project you can integrate Frontline mobile app with your Active Campaign contacts.


## Features

- Pull list of your contacts from Active Campaign
- Receieve and make calls
- Voicemails
- Inbound and outbound SMS with your contacts
- Send automated SMS
- Template Messages


## Code explaination

### Inbound Calls

```html
  <Response>
      <Connect action="handleVoicemail.php">
          <Conversation serviceInstanceSid="xxxxxxx" inboundTimeout="20"/>
      </Connect>
  </Response>
```

**serviceInstanceSid** is the service ID which is found in Twilio console

**Action** is the url which will be called if call is not picked up or rejected.

### Inbound SMS

```php
// add agent to convo
if ($agentNum == '+14400000000') {

    $agentId = 'agent1@example.com';
} elseif ($agentNum == '+14403000001') {

    $agentId = 'agent2@example.com';
} elseif ($agentNum == '+1440111111') {

    $agentId = 'agent3@example.com';
} else {

    $agentId = 'agent1@example.com';
}
```
Based on phone number we can assign the SMS to different agents.

### Outbound SMS

```php
{
    "proxy_address": "+1440000000"
}
```
Return the number from which to send SMS
